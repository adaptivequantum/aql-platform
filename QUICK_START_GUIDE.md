## üéØ Best Practices

### For Market Research
**Start broad, then narrow:** Begin with general market analysis, then drill into specific segments or behaviors.

**Use multiple modules:** Combine Analytics (numbers) + Research (psychology) + Trends (future) for comprehensive insights.

**Ask follow-up questions:** Each response can spark new questions - keep the conversation going.

### For Campaign Planning
**Define your objective first:** Tell the AI what you want to achieve (awareness, sales, engagement, etc.).

**Provide context:** Mention your industry, target audience, budget range, and timeline.

**Request specific deliverables:** Ask for timelines, budgets, KPIs, or channel recommendations.

### For Creative Work
**Be descriptive:** The more details you provide, the better the output.

**Specify style:** Mention desired aesthetics, mood, colors, or reference brands.

**Iterate:** Use the first output as a starting point and refine with follow-up requests.

### For Creative Analysis
**Describe comprehensively:** Include visual elements, copy, colors, layout, and brand context.

**Mention your market:** Specify if it's for Saudi/MENA market for culturally relevant insights.

**Ask for specifics:** Request focus on particular aspects (design, messaging, cultural fit, etc.).

## üî• Power User Tips

### Tip 1: Combine Modules
Use Assist AI to orchestrate multi-module workflows. For example: "First analyze the F&B market in Saudi Arabia, then create a Ramadan campaign strategy, then generate a product image."

### Tip 2: Save Good Prompts
When you find a prompt that works well, save it for future use. The platform remembers your session.

### Tip 3: Be Specific About Saudi Context
When relevant, mention "Saudi Arabia" or "MENA region" to get culturally appropriate insights and recommendations.

### Tip 4: Request Formats
Ask for specific output formats: "Give me this as a table," "Create a step-by-step timeline," "Provide this as bullet points."

### Tip 5: Iterate and Refine
Don't settle for the first response. Ask follow-up questions like "Can you elaborate on point 3?" or "What about the luxury segment?"
